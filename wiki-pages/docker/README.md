### Summary

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)):

> **Docker** is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. 

### Installing Docker Desktop

You can install Docker Desktop by following the link [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) to download and run the installer.

### Installing Docker Engine on Ubuntu

Follow the steps below to install Docker Engine on Ubuntu.

1. Ensure you uninstall any older versions of Docker Engine:

    ```bash
        sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc
    ```

2. Update your system and install the dependencies:

    ```bash
        sudo apt-get update

        sudo apt-get install \
            apt-transport-https \
            ca-certificates \
            curl \
            gnupg \
            lsb-release
    ```

3. Add Docker's GPG key:

    ```bash
        curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
    ```

4. Set up the repository for the **stable** version of Docker Engine:

    ```bash
        echo \
        "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
        $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
    ```

5. Update the system and install Docker Engine:

    ```bash
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
    ```

6. Verify that Docker Engine installed correctly:

    ```bash
        sudo docker run hello-world
    ```

### Running Docker without sudo

If you don't want to constantly include `sudo` in your calls to `docker`, then follow the steps below.

1. Create the `docker` group:

    ```bash
        sudo groupadd docker
    ```

2. Add your user to the `docker` group:

    ```bash
        sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
    ```

3. Log out and then log back in.

4. Activate the changes to groups:

    ```bash
        newgrp docker
    ```

5. Verify that you can call `docker` without `sudo`:

    ```bash
        docker run hello-world
    ```
