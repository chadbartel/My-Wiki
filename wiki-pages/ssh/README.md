### Summary

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell_Protocol):

> **SSH** (secure shell protocol) is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network. Typical applications include remote command-line, login, and remote command execution, but any network service can be secured with SSH.

### Auto-Start SSH Agent in Bash

This should only prompt for a password the first time you login after each reboot. It will keep reusing the same `ssh-agent` as long as it stays running. This solution was copied from [this Stack Exchange question](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/90853/how-can-i-run-ssh-add-automatically-without-a-password-prompt).

 1. Add the following to your `~/.bashrc` file:

    ```bash
        if [ ! -S ~/.ssh/ssh_auth_sock]; then
        eval `ssh-agent`
        ln -sf "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" ~/.ssh/ssh_auth_sock
        fi
        export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=~/.ssh/ssh_auth_sock
        ssh-add -l > /dev/null || ssh-add
    ```

 2. Logout and log back in for the change to take effect.

 3. *Optional*: If you would like to automatically add an SSH key to the agent, add the following line anywhere below the script you added in step #1:

    ```bash
        ssh-add ~/.ssh/your_private_ssh_key
    ```

    * This should only be necessary if you have a private key file that isn't named something like `id_rsa` or `id_ed25519`.

Alternatively, you can install `keychain` and simply add the keys to your keychain. This solution will ensure that the `ssh-agent` will use the key you specify only when you call the SSH service, not when you open bash or login. This was copied from [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52423626/remember-git-passphrase-in-wsl).

 1. Install `keychain`:

    ```bash
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install keychain
    ```

 2. Find your hostname in the terminal:

    ```bash
        hostname
    ```

 3. Add the following to either `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:

    ```bash
        /usr/bin/keychain --nogui ~/.ssh/your_private_key
        source $HOME/.keychain/YOUR-HOSTNAME-HERE-sh
    ```

    * Yes, suffix the hostname with `-sh`.

Further information on how to use `keychain` can be found [here](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/ssh-passwordless-login-with-keychain-for-scripts/).

### Add SSH to GitHub

In order to control your repositories on GitHub using SSH, follow the steps below, or review the official documentation [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh):

1. Open Git Bash and check to see if you have an existing key:

    ```bash
        ls -al ~/.ssh
    ```

    * The default filenames for these keys are one of the following:
        * *id_rsa.pub*
        * *id_ecdsa.pub*
        * *id_ed25519.pub*

2. If you don't have a key or wish to create a new one anyways, create a new key associated with your GitHub account email address:

    ```bash
        ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
    ```

3. Press "Enter" to accept the default file name and location.

4. When prompted, enter a password for your SSH key.

5. Start the `ssh-agent` in the background:

    ```bash
        eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
    ```

6. Add your SSH *private* key to the `ssh-agent`:

    ```bash
        ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
    ```

7. Copy your SSH *public* key to your clipboard.

8. Go to GitHub.com, login, and navigate to **Settings**.

9. On the left-hand sidebar, click **SSH and GPG keys**.

10. Click **New SSH key**.

11. Provide a descriptive title in the "Title" field.

12. Paste the key you copied to your clipboard into the "Key" field.

13. Click "Add SSH key".

14. If prompted, confirm your GitHub password.

15. Test your SSH key with the following command:

    ```bash
        ssh -T git@github.com
    ```

### Create SSH key for EC2

To create an SSH key for use with EC2 instances, they need to meet specific requirements. The following guide is adapted from the official AWS documentation found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html). Additionally, you can read the official SSH documentation on `ssh-keygen` [here](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/keygen).

**Requirements**:

* OpenSSH public key format (the format in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys). If you connect using SSH while using the EC2 Instance Connect API, the SSH2 format is also supported.

* Base64 encoded DER format

* SSH public key file format as specified in RFC4716

* SSH private key file format must be PEM

* Algorithm must be RSA

* The supported lengths are 1024, 2048, and 4096. If you connect using SSH while using the EC2 Instance Connect API, the supported lengths are 2048 and 4096.

1. Generate an SSH key with `ssh-keygen`:

    ```bash
        ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -m PEM
    ```

    * Note: the `-t` option allows selection of an algorithm and the `-b` option allows selection of key size.

2. Save the public and private key to a local file:

    * `~/.ssh/my-key-pair.pem`

    * `~/.ssh/my-key-pair.pub`

3. Change the permissions on your private key file such that only *you* can read it:

    ```bash
        chmod 400 ~/.ssh/my-key-pair.pem
    ```
